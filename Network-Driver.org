  NW interface are the 3rd class of Linux devices

  Similar to others(char & block) NW interface must register with
  NW specific kernel data structure.

  NW interface has no such entry point linke */dev/sda*.

  Normal file operations (read, write, ..) do not make sense when
  applied to NW interface.

  socket.read and socket.write calls act on a software object. that
  is distinct from NW interface.

  *Important difference* is, 'Block Driver' operate only in
  response to request from the kernel. Whereas 'Network Driver'
  packets asynchronously form the outside.

  The term *octect* refer to a group of eight bits.
